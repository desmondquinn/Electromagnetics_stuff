1d_fdtd is a simple 1D FDTD simulation to visualise light matter interaction 
A source (Gaussian pulse) injected at the left end of the grid, travels and interacts with a material of higher refractive index 
The edges of material 2 are marked by 2 straight lines. 
Requires ffmpeg for saving the animation
